    "# heapsort\n",
    "\n",
    "An in-place, array-based heap sort algorithm in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few concepts that are involved in heap sort which bear defining.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Type\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap can be either a _min_ heap or a _max_ heap. A min-heap has the lowest value at the top of the heap. A\n",
    "max-heap has the highest value at the top of the heap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Heap Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "A heap must have the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    " - It must be a _complete_ binary tree, meaning that the depths of any two leaf nodes must not differ by more than\n",
    "   one. The value of $abs(l_{i} - l_{j})$ for nodes $l_{i}$ and $l_{j}$ should only be zero or one, never greater\n",
    "   than one.\n",
    " - It must satisfy the _heap property_.\n",
    "   - For a max-heap, each node must be greater than or equal to the value of its children.\n",
    "   - For a min-heap, each node must be less than or equal to the value of each of its children.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Heap Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few operations which heaps usually must support:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Insert: insert a new element into an already valid heap.\n",
    " 2. Pop: remove the largest (in a max-heap) or the smallest (in a min-heap) value from a heap and repair the heap\n",
    "    property.\n",
    "    \n",
    "When building a heap in-place with totally unordered data, _sifting_ is another operation which works to repair\n",
    "the heap property.\n",
    "   \n",
    "### Heapifying\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways to take an invalid heap and repair it into a valid heap, _sift down_ and _sift up_.\n",
    "Taking an unordered array and creating a heap out of it is called _heapifying_ the array.\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Sift Up** works by repairing the heap property upward, carrying a value upward until the heap property is\n",
    "    satisfied.\n",
    " 2. **Sift Down** works by repairing the heap property downward, carrying a value downward until the heap property\n",
    "    is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sift Down Heapify\n",
    "\n",
    "Heapify via sift-down starts at the last index in the array and works toward index zero, sifting down at each \n",
    "index in the array in this given order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sift-down for a given node checks that the given node's value is $\\geq$ (greater than or equal to: max-heap) or\n",
    "$\\leq$ (less than or equal to: min-heap) its children.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **NOTE:** For reasons that are complicated, sift down amortizes to $O(n)$ time instead of what we would expect, \n",
    "> $O(n * log_{2}(n))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in reversed(range(len(data)):\n",
    "    sift_down(data, i)\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "#### Sift Up Heapify\n",
    "\n",
    "Heapify via sift-up starts at the first index in the array and sifts up for each following index in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sift-up for a given node checks that the given node's value is $\\leq$ (less than or equal to: max-heap) or $\\geq$\n",
    "(greater than or equal to: min-heap) the value of its parent. Sift-up climbs up the heap, repairing the heap as\n",
    "long as the heap property isn't satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for i in range(1, len(data)):\n",
    "    sift_up(data, i)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "A full heap-sort implementation, based on sift-down as described above, will work like so:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. **Heapify** the array into a max-heap.\n",
    "    - Iterate from the last index in the array to the first index in the array, calling sift-down on each index.\n",
    " 2. **Sort** the array by popping elements out of the heap.\n",
    "    1. Set an `end` index to the last index in the array.\n",
    "    2. Swap the first element in the heap (the largest value) with the element at `end`.\n",
    "    3. Sift down index zero, correcting the heap property, and stop sifting down before hitting `end`.\n",
    "    4. Decrement `end` and return to step 2.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In a max-heap, the largest value will always be at the head of the heap. Thus, by swapping it with the end of the\n",
    "array, this will place the largest element at the last index, the second-largest element at the penultimate index,\n",
    "and so on and so forth, resulting in a sorted array."
